<h2>The Price of Freedom</h2>
<ul>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
The Price of Freedom is a game where players are forced to retrieve critical information from a disaster site.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
Players should feel pressed for time when playing this game. The controls and unpredictable nature of the game hazards should contribute to the feeling of urgency players experience.
</li>

<li><strong>Genre:</strong>
This is a race-against-the-clock type game. The game genre also involves managing two opposing gameplay mechanics.
</li>

<li><strong>Game play:</strong>
Players control the avatar character by using the mouse pointer location and the mouse buttons. When the player presses a mouse button the avatar will begin to accelerate towards the current location of the mouse pointer. The farther away from the avatar the pointer is the higher the speed the avatar will attain while moving. Momentum is very dangerous in this game and needs to be managed to prevent the player from taking too much radiation damage. Moving objects in the game world represent high levels of radiation which must be avoided. If the player can maneuver the avatar to the information an exit will appear in the game world from which they can escape. Players must complete the game in a limited amount of time.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype goal:</strong>
The goal of this prototype is to have players balance the need to progress quickly towards the goal with the need to not move so fast that the momentum of the avatar leads to their death. Players need to show patience in some situations and haste in others.
</li>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>
Players have limited control of the avatar which when combined with the pseudorandom movement of the radiation hazards can make for unpredictable gameplay experiences.
</li>

<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
The game world is a nuclear disaster site. The objects in the game world represent dangerously high levels of radiation. The avatar is a representation of the player navigating through this disaster area trying to stay alive.
</li>

<li><strong>Story:</strong>
A nuclear disaster has occurred in the lands of a secretive, repressive country. You have been tasked by your government to enter this disaster area and retrieve critical information which will help explain the cause of the accident. If you refuse to do this you will be executed. If you fail to retrieve the information you will be executed. You have to navigate the hazards of the disaster site and retrieve the information in a limited amount of time to survive.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
While anyone is encouraged to play, the setting may not be appropriate for all ages. A safe age range would be ten or higher.
</li>

<li><strong>Play time:</strong>
The game sessions can last around a maximum of two minutes due to the countdown timer.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
Players need to learn how to manipulate the avatar to get it to move quickly and slowly when needed. This involves keeping the pointer close to the avatar for slower speeds and farther away for faster speeds. Players can lessen or stop the momentum of the avatar by placing the pointer far away from the avatar in the opposite direction it is traveling. Players should give movement commands to the avatar as quickly as possible to prevent the acceleration of the avatar from getting to unmanageable levels.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
All image assets made by internal design team. All audio assets taken from public domain sources.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
Any game where the input controls are designed to be less precise can be considered an influence on this game. Games with mechanics that involve maintaining a balance between two opposing or competing forces would be considered similar to the game prototype.
